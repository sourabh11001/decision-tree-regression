# Decision Tree Regression using Python

This project demonstrates how **Decision Tree Regression** can be used to predict continuous outcomes by learning decision rules from data features. Unlike linear models, decision trees can model **non-linear and complex relationships** effectively without requiring feature transformation.

---

## 🔍 Objective
To implement and visualize a **Decision Tree Regressor** that predicts target values by splitting data into smaller, interpretable segments.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – for data analysis and handling  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for visualizing predictions and decision boundaries  
- **Scikit-learn** – for training and evaluating the Decision Tree Regressor  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Import and explore the dataset  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values and prepare features  
3. **Model Training** – Build and train a Decision Tree Regressor using Scikit-learn  
4. **Prediction** – Predict outcomes on test data  
5. **Evaluation** – Use metrics like R² Score and Mean Squared Error  
6. **Visualization** – Plot predicted vs actual results and tree structure  

---

## 📈 Results
The Decision Tree model effectively fits the dataset and captures non-linear relationships between features and target variables. Visualizations help in understanding how the model splits data based on key features.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Understanding how Decision Trees work for regression tasks  
- Visualizing tree-based model decisions  
- Comparing overfitting and underfitting scenarios  
- Interpreting regression results from decision-based models

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Apply **Random Forest Regression** for better accuracy  
- Use **Hyperparameter tuning** (max_depth, min_samples_split)  
- Visualize decision boundaries using feature importance plots
